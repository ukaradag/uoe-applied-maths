    "Now, it is time move on to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation! The first task you are asked to perform is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Your model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The first question to ask your boss is what exactly is the business objective; building a model is probably not the end goal. **How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?** This is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, what algorithms you will select, what performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you should spend tweaking it.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The next question to ask is **what the current solution looks like (if any)**. It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In some cases, we may wish to apply transformations to our data, so that they have a more Gaussian distribution (an assumption of a number of the models we will use later). For example, log transformations are useful for altering count data to have a more normal distribution as they pull in the more extreme high values relative to the median, while stretching back extreme low values away from the median. You can use a log transformation with either the pre-made `LogTransformer()` from `feature_engine.transformation`, or a custom function and `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the natural logarithm, square root, and inverse transformations are special cases of the **Box-Cox** family of transformations (Box and Cox 1964). The question is why do we need such a transformation and when? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that, the method is typically used to transform the outcome, but can also be used to transform predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The method assumes that the variable takes only positive values. If there are any zero or negative values, a modification of the Box-Cox that allows non-positive values (Box-Cox with negatives, BCN) can be used (Hawkins and Weisberg 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "- If there are zero values, but no negative values, an option is to add a small number (e.g. 1) before carrying out the transformation, although if there are a large number of zero values then it is possible no Box-Cox transformation will sufficiently normalize the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the Box-Cox procedure was developed to transform the outcome and uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate a transformation parameter $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tilde{y} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l l} \\frac{y^{\\lambda} - 1}{\\lambda}, & \\lambda \\neq 0 \\\\ \\log y, & \\lambda = 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right.$\n",
    "\n",
